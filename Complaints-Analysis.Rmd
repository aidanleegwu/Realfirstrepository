```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

complaints <- readRDS("complaints.rds")

View(complaints)

company_issues <- complaints %>% 
  filter(issue == "Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem", ) %>% 
  group_by(company) %>% 
  count(issue, sub_issue) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

legal_action <- complaints %>% 
  filter(issue == "Took or threatened to take negative or legal action") %>% 
  group_by(company, sub_product) %>% 
  count(issue) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

view(legal_action)


write_rds(legal_action, "legal_action.xlsx")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
